    "Okay, but WHY does it matter to answer these questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On an average, brands spend 13.8% of overall company revenue on marketing as of 2022. That's about 5% growth since 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small business and start-ups don't have enough budget to invest in excessive marketing and advertising. So it becomes pivotal\n",
    "to ensure every penny of their tight-budget marketing expeditures are being effective enough. Which implies that they need a number to quantify and compare different influencers so that they know whom to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our analysis of influencers and quality score, small business and startup's can select an influencer to represent their brand. This analysed quality score will also consider if that influencer's content matches with the brand requirment. For example, if a brand is looking to promote its new release handbag, the generated quality score will be highest for the fashion influencer who scores high on all the other considered metrics. This will ensure that enagaging with that particular influencer will help with brand reach and grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, \n",
    "\n",
    "Brands can't spend a whole day stalking each influencer to decide if they are the 'right fit' for an upcoming campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                    We instead leverage the power of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that means using various metrics pertaining to an influncer 'quality' and reach of an influencer, to aid in \n",
