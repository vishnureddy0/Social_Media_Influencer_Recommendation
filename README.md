# Social_Media_Influencer_Recommendation

PROBLEM STATEMENT!
02
To connect small businesses with
the right micro and mini Instagram 
influencers to ensure efficient
utilization of marketing costs.
We sampled 100,000 profiles from 
the dataset available.
Dropping cts columns, dropping 
profiles of sid, profile_id and 
profile_name with null values,
As we are considering profiles of nano 
to mini, we will filter followers in the 
range of 1000 - 1000000

We will map three datasets on basis 
of sid,id,name and cd columns
We are extracting 3 datasets from 
Kaggle with 42 million Instagram 
posts, 1 million locations & 4 million 
profiles

Analysis 2: Where isthe highest traffic
08
Observations
North-Eastern America has the highest 
traffic in the continent
Most Numbers of the posts in the 
database have been made in WestEurope
Eastern-Asia, Africa, China, and
Russia have the most minor 
number users
Inferences
A global start-up could prioritize 
North- East America and WestEurope supply chains considering 
high traffic.
Instagram influencer marketing
shouldn't be an approach to business 
owners with target audiences in 
Eastern-Asia, African, China, and
Russia, as there aren't many users 
from these areas.

Which day of the week has the 
highest traffic?
What is the best time to post on a sunday? 
When should I not consider making a post?
Analysis 3: When is everyone posting?


CONCLUSIONS
11
With better utilization of all variables from
the static data, we can create
a formula
that genuinely considers every aspect of
a
user's profile and judge them precisely to
the requirements of
a business
.
This model can be enhanced with the
availability of real
-time data and user
analytics report of the users
.
The future scope for this project would be 
to work on universal data of the platform 
and perform real
-time analysis on all the 
new time series metrics like stories,
